### Layer 3: Dynamic Narrative Engine
- **Adaptive Dialogue**: Generates contextually appropriate responses
- **Theory Development**: Helps formulate and refine working theories
- **Timeline Construction**: Builds chronological understanding of events
- **Summary Generation**: Creates comprehensive recaps and journal entries

### Layer 4: Reasoning & Hints System
- **Logical Analysis**: Connects clues through deductive reasoning
- **Frustration Detection**: Identifies when player needs assistance
- **Smart Hints**: Provides contextual help without spoiling solutions
- **Reasoning Maps**: Visualizes logical connections and investigation paths

### Structured JSON Output
All new features return structured data for better integration:
```json
{
  "objects_detected": ["list of objects"],
  "text_excerpts": ["extracted text"],
  "anomalies": ["suspicious details"],
  "initial_theories": ["preliminary theories"],
  "next_investigation_steps": ["suggested actions"]
}
```
